        "description": "The general purpose of customer satisfaction surveys is to assess how satisfied your customers are with different aspects of your product/service. Identifying unhappy customers is as important as identifying extremely happy ones (potential advocates).Having (and maintaining) happy customers improves the odds of repeat purchases as well as raises your general customer lifetime value.Unhappy customers, on the other hand, can be a lot more harmful than you think. Ask them to rate their satisfaction with a specific aspect on a 1 to 10 scale.Using scales to measure customer satisfaction makes it a lot more practical to measure changes in satisfaction over time. That’s even more important when trying to measure the impact of a specific initiative.Measuring and tracking your overall customer satisfaction is the first and most important step towards creating amazing experiences. Keep that in mind, always, and you’ll be on the right path towards developing an awesome product/service.",

They are delivered to users directly on the website and they pose a series of questions related to a specific topic that visitors should provide answers to. The data collected by the surveys is then interpreted with the aim of improving the product, service or user experience. Feedback surveys are one of the best ways to find out what customers like or dislike about a website, product or service. There are other indirect methods of finding out what visitors prefer such as heat maps, click maps or session recordings but their interpretation is subject to an increased degree of subjectivity from the marketers overseeing the project.",

Exactly why do they feel that way? Were the meeting objectives clearly communicated in advance? Were they met? Were follow-up actions decided on and assigned? How well was the meeting moderated? You can also find out if attendees feel they had the opportunity to participate in the meeting--and if all the right people were invited to attend. Our meeting feedback questionnaire even gives attendees an opportunity to assess the meeting logistics, timeliness, and overall effectiveness of the meeting. Taking time to find out how attendees feel about a meeting afterwards can help you plan more focused and effective meetings for the next time!",
